# üèóÔ∏è Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) @ Hawkes Workshop Materials

This repository contains the materials, code, and exercises from the 2025 Workshops on Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP). 

The goal of this repository is to provide a working example and reference for building analytical pipelines that are **reproducible, auditable, efficient, and of high quality**, following the best practices of software engineering.

### **Overview: What is a RAP?**

A Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) is an automated analytical process that replaces manual steps (like copy-pasting or drag-and-drop operations) with code.

Key principles demonstrated in this workshop include:

* **Python Best Practices:** Using python in a structured way to faciliated clean publications .
* **UCL CS Cluster Team:** Tips, tricks and using the Cluster.
